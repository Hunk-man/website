        <h2>Biden has new demands for Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu</h2>
<img src="biden.jpg" alt="Biden">

<p><strong>Biden said the handling of the Hamas war by Israel's Prime Minister "has been a mistake." Biden has told PM Benjamin to cease fire now! Biden spoke with Benjamin on Wednesday, and President Biden had to say this: "The fact of the matter is he agreed to new several things that related to my number one priority: getting more aid, more food, and medicine into Gaza and reducing civilian casualties." He wants Hamas to propose a pause in the war, which could result in 40 hostages being released! After interviewing the people in Gaza, they said they just want it to be over, with one woman saying, "I lost my kids, I feel like I lost myself. We have no food or drink, it's awful."</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hamas invaded Israel on Oct. 7 and slaughtered 1,200 people, including over 30 Americans. Hospitals are protected institutions during war under international law. However, the medical centers in the Gaza Strip have frequently been turned into de facto military installations by Hamas to wage war against Israel. Hospitals lose their protected rights when they are converted into military sites. Hamas uses medical compounds to hold hostages.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hamas currently has over 100 hostages, including Americans, in its captivity. The Hamas-held hostages are believed to be in Rafah, the main stronghold of Hamas battalions.</strong></p>
